# Inheritance Demo
This is a purposfully simple example of how to implement inheritance with Salesforce LWC components.

If you are creating multiple components with shared Javascript and/or CSS, you can employ these two techniques in order to simplify your code base and reduce maintainance overhead.

I suggest running the demoHarness (c-demo-harness) control in a Local Development Server in order that you can change and experiment. You could put this same harness control into a Salesforce org as well if you wanted though.
